# howzit

A reference tool for project build systems

## File Structure

Where are the main editable files? Is there a dist/build folder that should be ignored?

## Build

What build system does this use? E.g. rake, make, gulp, etc.

Commands in @directives can be triggered with `howzit -r`

@run(gulp scripts)

## Deploy

What are the procedures/commands to deploy this project?

Use fenced code blocks with "run" as the language to run multiple commands as a script.

```run
echo "This is a run block"
echo "Did it work?"
```

```run
#!/bin/bash
echo "Let's try another one"
echo "Did that one work?"
```
